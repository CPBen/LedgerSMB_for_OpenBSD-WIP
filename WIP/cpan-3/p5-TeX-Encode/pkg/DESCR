This module provides encoding to LaTeX escapes from utf8 using mapping
tables in Pod::LaTeX and HTML::Entities. This covers only a subset of
the Unicode character table (undef warnings will occur for non-mapped
chars). This module is intentionally vague about what it will handle,
see Caveats below.
