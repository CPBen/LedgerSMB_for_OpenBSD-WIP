Perl 5.8.0 misses subtraction and intersection of characters, which is
described in Unicode Regular Expressions (UTS #18). This module provides
a mimic syntax of character classes including subtraction and
intersection, taking advantage of look-ahead assertions. The syntax
provided by this module is considerably incompatible with the standard
Perl's regex syntax.
