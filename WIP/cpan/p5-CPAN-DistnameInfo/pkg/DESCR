Many online services that are centered around CPAN attempt to associate
multiple uploads by extracting a distribution name from the filename of
the upload. For most distributions this is easy as they have used
ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Build to create the distribution, which
results in a uniform name. But sadly not all uploads are created in this
way.
