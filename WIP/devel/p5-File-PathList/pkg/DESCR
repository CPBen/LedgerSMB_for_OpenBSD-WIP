Many systems that map generic relative paths to absolute paths do so
with a set of base paths.
For example, Perl itself when loading classes first turn a Class::Name
into a path like Class/Name.pm, and then looks through each element of
@INC to find the actual file.
To aid in portability, all relative paths are provided as Unix-style
relative paths, and converted to the localised version in the process of
looking up the path.
