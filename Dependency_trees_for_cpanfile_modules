This is a token file to point out that each cpanfile module produces a
tree of dependencies that may be really long and complicated.

Pointing out changes to the cpanfile for LedgerSMB itself is great help.
So is pointing out any CPAN module that gets added to base Perl in OpenBSD.

The best way to deal with these dependencies is to start with the new ones
farthest out from the module trying to be brought in.
This allows port reviewers to build all or some of these dependencies.

It is often best to submit several ports of these together.

Please be sure to say that these ports are for LedgerSMB!
Ask for comments or help as needed. Please make the message short unless
there are issues to bring up.

Look at messages on ports@openbsd.org to see how the traditional method is.

Port reviewers are usually very busy or have no interest in these new ports.

After a few weeks, please send a simple message on the same thread with a
"Ping".

Thanks.
