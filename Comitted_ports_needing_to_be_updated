This will be a list of ports that are already in the tree but need to
be updated. This may mean adding new dependencies.
Updating is usually very easy.

Sometimes ports are tied into many other existing ports in general that
need special handling because they affect something really complicated.
Asking for help on ports@openbsd.org for advice is appropriate.
