# LedgerSMB_for_OpenBSD-WIP
This is a staging area for work to be submitted to ports@openbsd.org
The cpan directory is preliminary work created by the portgen program
to get a port started. Usually all of the files need editing.
The Makefiles may lack BUILD_DEPENDS, RUN_DEPENDS and TEST_DEPENDS.
The pkg/DESCR often needs revising.
Building and testing the port is a must.
After working on a port, the cpan category needs to be changed to a correct
category.

Right now, this work is strictly for LedgerSMB 1.9.x.
1.10.x may become the LedgerSMB version later.
1.7.x and 1.8.x are losing support soon or already.

There is a big messy repository of WIP and some submitted ports.

This was created during an emergency, so it was just a super rushed
attempt to not lose any files.
There is good stuff buried within over there. Junk, too.
