As a dynamic language, Perl doesn't require you to define subroutines
until run-time. Although this is a powerful feature, it can also be a
major source of bugs. For example, you might mistype the name of a
subroutine, or call a subroutine from another module without including
that module or importing that subroutine. And unless you have very good
test coverage, you might not know about these bugs until you have
already launched your code.
